This 2D platformer game involves a single user-controlled character that can use the game’s environment to their advantage using gravity-based power-ups. These power-ups allow the player to advance through a level by performing actions such as moving and manipulating paths or objects for level advancement, fighting/avoiding enemies and hazards, and solving puzzles to obtain mission objectives. Obstacles in this game come in many forms, ranging from enemies trying to attack the player in various fashions, which would deduct the player’s points, health, and etc. Other forms include possible hazardous components within the environment, such as missing paths, falling debris, and “hot zones” that trigger an action that puts the player in danger.
